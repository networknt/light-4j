# Scalable Config file
#
# This file serves as a configuration extension platform. Functions are list below:
#
# [1]   exclusionConfigFileList: this configuration will be used by the light-4j/config module, when reading
#       config files. it allows the listing of files which will be excluded from parameterized values set at
#       the command-line or in a values.yml file
#       Notes:
#       File name included in the list will be excluded
#       If the file is not provided, the config module will safely ignore it
#       Simply list the config file names without extensions(.json, .yaml, .yml)

# For some configuration files, we have left some properties without default values as there
# would be negative impact on the application security. The following config will ensure that
# null will be used when the default value is empty without stopping the server during the start.
allowDefaultValueEmpty: true

# For some operating systems, environment variable can be only upper case, to make sure they can
# match the key defined in each config files, we can convert the env vars to upper case to match.
# The default value is true, and it will cover most operating systems (Linux and Windows). Change
# this value to false if you have lower or mix case environment variable names.
convertEnvVars: true
