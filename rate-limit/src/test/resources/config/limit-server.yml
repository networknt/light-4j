# This is a serer wide rate limit configuration. It is usually used by the embedded gateway.

# If this handler is enabled or not. It is disabled by default as this handle might be in
# most http-sidecar, light-proxy and light-router instances. However, it should only be used
# internally to throttle request for a slow backend service or externally for DDoS attacks.
enabled: ${limit.enabled:true}
# To make the old config file still work, we are using this concurrentRequest to set as 1
# request per second. If you are using the new handler, please don't use this property.
# Same as rateLimit: 1 1s
concurrentRequest: ${limit.concurrentRequest:1}
# request rate limit: 10 1s 1000 1h
# 10 requests per second limit and 1000 requests per day quota.
rateLimit: ${limit.rateLimit:100/s 10000/h}
# Overflow request queue size. -1 means there is no limit on the queue size and this should
# only be used in the corporate network for throttling. For Internet facing service, set it
# to a small value to prevent DDoS attacks. New requests will be dropped with 503 response
# code returned if the queue is full.
queueSize: ${limit.queueSize:1}
# If the rate limit is exposed to the Internet to prevent DDoS attacks, it will return 503
# error code to trick the DDoS client/tool to stop the attacks as it considers the server
# is down. However, if the rate limit is used internally to throttle the client requests to
# protect a slow backend API, it will return 429 error code to indicate too many requests
# for the client to wait a grace period to resent the request. By default, 503 is returned.
errorCode: ${limit.errorCode:429}
# Key of the rate limit: server, address, client
# server: The entire server has one rate limit key, and it means all users share the same.
# address: The IP address is the key and each IP will have its rate limit configuration.
# client: The client id in the JWT token so that we can give rate limit per client.
key: ${limit.key:server}
# Address specific rate limit if they don't follow the default rateLimit definition.
