# path prefix to the api key mapping. It is a list of map between the path prefix and the api key
# for apikey authentication. In the handler, it loops through the list and find the matching path
# prefix. Once found, it will check if the apikey is equal to allow the access or return an error.
# The map object has three properties: pathPrefix, headerName and apiKey. Take a look at the test
# resources/config folder for configuration examples.
