This will be default setting\nIf the egressIngressIndicator set protocol, sidecar will router request based on protocol. normally the traffic inside pod will http (from api container to sidecar container), and sidecar will treat http traffic as egress router\nIf the egressIngressIndicator set as other values, currently sidecar will skip router handler and leave the request traffic to proxy\n",
