/***
 SimpleURIConnectionPool is a connection pool for a single URI, which means that it manages a pool of reusable
 connections to a single URI.
 Threads borrow connections from the pool, use them, and then return them back to the pool. Since these returned
 connections are already active / established, they can be used immediately without going through the lengthy connection
 establishment process. This can very significantly increase the performance of systems that make many simultaneous
 outgoing API calls.

 Internally, SimpleURIConnectionPool organizes connections into 4 (possibly overlapping) sets:

 1. allCreatedConnections    all connections created for the pool by the pool's SimpleConnectionMaker
 2. trackedConnections:      all connections tracked by the connection pool
 3. Borrowable:              all tracked connections that can be borrowed from
 4. Borrowed:                all tracked connections that have borrowed tokens
 5. notBorrowedExpired:      all tracked connections that are both expired and not borrowed -- only these can be closed by the pool
