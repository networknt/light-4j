 * composed managers trusts a certificate chain, then it is trusted by the composite manager.
 *
 * This is necessary because of the fine-print on javax.net.ssl.SSLContext.init:
 *     Only the first instance of a particular key and/or trust manager implementation type in the
 *     array is used. (For example, only the first javax.net.ssl.X509KeyManager in the array will be used.)
