# Support individual handler chains for each separate endpoint. It allows framework
# handlers like health check, server info to bypass majority of the middleware handlers
# and allows mixing multiple frameworks like OpenAPI and GraphQL in the same instance.

# handlers  --  list of handlers to be used across chains in this microservice
#               including the routing handlers for ALL endpoints
#           --  format: fully qualified handler class name@optional:given name
# chains    --  allows forming of [1..N] chains, which could be wholly or
#               used to form handler chains for each endpoint
#               ex.: default chain below, reused partially across multiple endpoints
# paths     --  list all the paths to be used for routing within the microservice
#           ----  path: the URI for the endpoint (ex.: path: '/v1/pets')
#           ----  method: the operation in use (ex.: 'post')
#           ----  exec: handlers to be executed -- this element forms the list and
#                       the order of execution for the handlers
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - to avoid executing a handler, it has to be removed/commented out in the chain
#   or change the enabled:boolean to false for a middleware handler configuration.
# - all handlers, routing handler included, are to be listed in the execution chain
# - for consistency, give a name to each handler; it is easier to refer to a name
#   vs a fully qualified class name and is more elegant
# - you can list in chains the fully qualified handler class names, and avoid using the
#   handlers element altogether
