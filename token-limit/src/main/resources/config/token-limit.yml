# The max number of duplicated token requests. Once this number is passed, the limit is triggered. This
# number is set based on the number of client instances as each instance might get its token if there
# is no distributed cache. The duplicated tokens are calculated based on the local in memory cache per
# light-gateway or oauth-kafka instance. Note: cache.yml needs to be configured.

# Different OAuth 2.0 providers have different token request path. To make sure that this handler only
# applied to the token endpoint, we define a list of path templates here to ensure request path is matched.
# The following is an example with two different OAuth 2.0 providers in values.yml file.
# token-limit.tokenPathTemplates:
#   - /oauth2/(?<instanceId>[^/]+)/v1/token
#   - /oauth2/(?<instanceId>[^/]+)/token
