# This is the config file to replace the default config loader to a customized one.
# For example, load the config files from the config server instead of filesystem.
# The following dummy entry is just to prevent the warning message during startup.
dummy: dummyEntry
# For real config loader config, please follow the format below with your implementation.
# light-4j provides a DefaultConfigLoader that loads config files from the light-portal
# and fallback to local file systems for cached config files.
# The following is the config for the DefaultConfigLoader.
# configLoaderClass: com.networknt.server.DefaultConfigLoader
# All variables below can be used to look up the config files for a particular service,
# but only the productId is required. If other variables are not provided, the default
# "current" value will be used from the config server.

# productId: light-gateway
# productVersion: 2.0.0
# apiId: com.networknt.petstore-1.0.0
# apiVersion: 1.0.0
