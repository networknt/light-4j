# Security configuration for security module in light-4j. For each individual framework,

# verification are enabled or not.

# This configuration file is only for JwtHelper class most of the cases. However, if there
# is no framework specific security configuration available. The fallback security config
# is read from this file. Hence we leave the enableVerifyJwt and enableVerifyScope to true.
