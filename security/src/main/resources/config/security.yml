# Security configuration for security module in light-4j. For each individual framework,
# it has a framework specific security config file to control if security and scopes
# verification are enabled or not.

# This configuration file is only for JwtHelper class most of the cases. However, if there
# is no framework specific security configuration available. The fallback security config
# is read from this file. Hence, we leave the enableVerifyJwt and enableVerifyScope to true.

# Enable the JWT verification flag. The JwtVerifierHandler will skip the JWT token verification
# if this flag is false. It should only be set to false on the dev environment for testing
# purposes. If you have some endpoints that want to skip the JWT verification, you can put the
# request path prefix in skipPathPrefixes.
enableVerifyJwt: ${security.enableVerifyJwt:true}

# Enable the SWT verification flag. The SwtVerifierHandler will skip the SWT token verification
# if this flag is false. It should only be set to false on the dev environment for testing
# purposes. If you have some endpoints that want to skip the SWT verification, you can put the
# request path prefix in skipPathPrefixes.
enableVerifySwt: ${security.enableVerifySwt:false}

# swt clientId header name. When light-gateway is used and the consumer app does not want to save
# the client secret in the configuration file, it can be passed in the header.

# Extract JWT scope token from the X-Scope-Token header and validate the JWT token
enableExtractScopeToken: ${security.enableExtractScopeToken:true}

# Enable JWT scope verification. This flag is valid when enableVerifyJwt is true. When using the
# light gateway as a centralized gateway without backend API specifications, you can still enable
# this flag to allow the admin endpoints to have scopes verified. And all backend APIs without
# specifications skip the scope verification if the spec does not exist with the skipVerifyScopeWithoutSpec
# flag to true. Also, you need to have the openapi.yml specification file in the config folder to
# enable it, as the scope verification compares the scope from the JWT token and the scope in the
# endpoint specification.
enableVerifyScope: ${security.enableVerifyScope:true}

# Users should only use this flag in a shared light gateway if the backend API specifications are
# unavailable in the gateway config folder. If this flag is true and the enableVerifyScope is true,
# the security handler will invoke the scope verification for all endpoints. However, if the endpoint
# doesn't have a specification to retrieve the defined scopes, the handler will skip the scope verification.
skipVerifyScopeWithoutSpec: ${security.skipVerifyScopeWithoutSpec:false}

# Enable JWT scope verification. 
# Only valid when (enableVerifyJwt is true) AND (enableVerifyScope is true)

# Enable SWT scope verification.
# Only valid when (enableVerifySwt is true) AND (enableVerifyScope is true)
enableVerifySwtScopeToken: ${security.enableVerifySwtScopeToken:true}

# If set true, the JWT verifier handler will pass if the JWT token is expired already. Unless
# you have a strong reason, please use it only on the dev environment if your OAuth 2 provider
# doesn't support long-lived token for dev environment or test automation.
ignoreJwtExpiry: ${security.ignoreJwtExpiry:false}

# User for test only. should be always be false on official environment.
enableMockJwt: ${security.enableMockJwt:false}

# Enables relaxed verification for jwt. e.g. Disables key length requirements.

# Enable or disable JWT token logging for audit. This is to log the entire token
# or choose the next option that only logs client_id, user_id and scope.
logJwtToken: ${security.logJwtToken:true}

# Enable or disable client_id, user_id and scope logging.
logClientUserScope: ${security.logClientUserScope:false}

# Enable JWT token cache to speed up verification. This will only verify expired time
# and skip the signature verification as it takes more CPU power and a long time. If
# each request has a different jwt token, like authorization code flow, this indicator
# should be turned off. Otherwise, the cached jwt will only be removed after 15 minutes
# and the cache can grow bigger if the number of requests is very high. This will cause
# memory kill in a Kubernetes pod if the memory setting is limited.
enableJwtCache: ${security.enableJwtCache:true}

# If enableJwtCache is true, then an error message will be shown up in the log if the
# cache size is bigger than the jwtCacheFullSize. This helps the developers to detect
# cache problem if many distinct tokens flood the cache in a short period of time. If
# you see JWT cache exceeds the size limit in logs, you need to turn off the enableJwtCache
# or increase the cache full size to a bigger number from the default 100.
jwtCacheFullSize: ${security.jwtCacheFullSize:100}

# If you are using light-oauth2, then you don't need to have oauth subfolder for public
# key certificate to verify JWT token, the key will be retrieved from key endpoint once
# the first token is arrived. Default to false for dev environment without oauth2 server
# or official environment that use other OAuth 2.0 providers.
bootstrapFromKeyService: ${security.bootstrapFromKeyService:false}

# Used in light-oauth2 and oauth-kafka key service for federated deployment. Each instance
# will have a providerId, and it will be part of the kid to allow each instance to get the
# JWK from other instance based on the providerId in the kid.

# Define a list of path prefixes to skip the security to ease the configuration for the
# handler.yml so that users can define some endpoint without security even through it uses
# the default chain. This is particularly useful in the light-gateway use case as the same
# instance might be shared with multiple consumers and providers with different security
# requirement. The format is a list of strings separated with commas or a JSON list in
# values.yml definition from config server, or you can use yaml format in this file.
skipPathPrefixes: ${security.skipPathPrefixes:}

# When light-gateway or http-sidecar is used for security, sometimes, we need to pass some
# claims from the JWT or SWT to the backend API for further verification or audit. You can
# select some claims to pass to the backend API with HTTP headers. The format is a map of
# claim in the token and a header name that the downstream API is expecting. You can use
# both JSON or YAML format.
# When SwtVerifyHandler is used, the claim names are in https://github.com/networknt/light-4j/blob/master/client/src/main/java/com/networknt/client/oauth/TokenInfo.java
# When JwtVerifyHandler is used, the claim names is the JwtClaims claimName.
# YAML
