# Light Router Configuration
# As this router is built to support discovery and security for light-4j services,
# the outbound connection is always HTTP 2.0 with TLS enabled.
# If HTTP 2.0 protocol will be accepted from incoming request.
http2Enabled: false

# If TLS is enabled when accepting incoming request. Should be true on test and prod.
httpsEnabled: true

# Max request time in milliseconds before timeout to the server.
maxRequestTime: 1000

# Rewrite Host Header with the target host and port and write X_FORWARDED_HOST with original host
rewriteHostHeader: true

# Reuse XForwarded for the target XForwarded header
reuseXForwarded: false

# Max Connection Retries
maxConnectionRetries: 3

# allowed host list. Use Regex to do wildcard match
hostWhitelist: ${router.hostWhitelist:}

# support serviceId in the query parameter for routing to overwrite serviceId in header routing.
# by default, it is false and should not be used unless you are dealing with a legacy client that
# does not support header manipulation. Once this flag is true, we are going to overwrite the header
# service_id derived with other handlers from prefix, path, endpoint etc.
serviceIdQueryParameter: ${router.serviceIdQueryParameter:false}

# URL rewrite rules, each line will have two parts: the regex patten and replace string separated
# with a space. The light-router has service discovery for host routing, so whe working on the
# url rewrite rules, we only need to create about the path in the URL.
# Test your rules at https://www.freeformatter.com/java-regex-tester.html
urlRewriteRules: ${router.urlRewriteRules:}

# Method rewrite rules for legacy clients that do not support DELETE, PUT, and PATCH HTTP methods to
# send a request with GET and POST instead. The gateway will rewrite the method from GET to DELETE or
# from POST to PUT or PATCH. This will be set up at the endpoint level to limit the application.
# The format of the rule will be "path source-method target-method". Please refer to test values.yml for
# examples.
# Note: you cannot rewrite a method with a body to a method without a body or vice versa.
methodRewriteRules: ${router.methodRewriteRules:}

# Query parameter rewrite rules for client applications that send different query parameter keys or values
# than the target server expecting. When overwriting a value, the key must be specified in order to
# identify the right query parameter. If only the ok and nk are specified, the router will rewrite the
# query parameter key ok with different key nk and keep the value.
# The format of the rule will be a map with the path as the key. Please refer to test values.yml for
# examples.

# Header rewrite rules for client applications that send different header keys or values than the target
# server expecting. When overwriting a value, the key must be specified in order to identify the right
# header. If only the ok and nk are specified, the router will rewrite the header key ok with different
# key nk and keep the value.
