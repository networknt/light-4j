# Light Router Configuration
# As this router is built to support discovery and security for light-4j services,
# the outbound connection is always HTTP 2.0 with TLS enabled.

# If HTTP 2.0 protocol will be accepted from incoming request.
http2Enabled: true

# If TLS is enabled when accepting incoming request. Should be true on test and prod.
httpsEnabled: true

# Max request time in milliseconds before timeout to the server.
maxRequestTime: 1000

# Rewrite Host Header with the target host and port and write X_FORWARDED_HOST with original host
rewriteHostHeader: true

# Reuse XForwarded for the target XForwarded header
reuseXForwarded: false

# Max Connection Retries
maxConnectionRetries: 3

# allowed host list. Use Regex to do wildcard match
hostWhitelist: ${router.hostWhitelist:.*}

# support serviceId in the query parameter for routing to overwrite serviceId in header routing.
# by default, it is false and shouldn't be used unless you are dealing with a legacy client that
# doesn't support header manipulation. Once this flag is true, we are going to overwrite the header
# service_id derived with other handlers from prefix, path, endpoint etc.
serviceIdQueryParameter: ${router.serviceIdQueryParameter:false}

# URL rewrite rules, each line will have type source target and type can be "string" or "regex"
