# Basic Authentication Security Configuration for light-4j
---
# Enable Basic Authentication Handler, default is false.
enabled: ${basic.enabled:false}
# Do we allow the anonymous to pass the authentication and limit it with some paths
# to access? Default is false, and it should only be true in client-proxy.
allowAnonymous: ${basic.allowAnonymous:false}
# Allow the Basic Auth to pass to the next handler if other authorization header exists
# i.e. OAuth 2.0 Bearer token. When this flag is true, the chain will go to the next
# handler like JwtVerifyHandler might be used to verify the Bearer token. This feature
# is used in proxy-client that support multiple clients with different authorizations.
allowOtherAuth: ${basic.allowOtherAuth:false}
# usernames and passwords in a list, the password can be encrypted like user2 in test.
# As we are supporting multiple users, so leave the passwords in this file with users.
# For each user, you can specify a list of optional paths that this user is allowed to
# access. A special user anonymous can be used to set the paths for client without an
# authorization header. The paths are optional and used for proxy only to authorize.
